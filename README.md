# Problem Statement

- Singapore is so small, I dont know what to do over the weekend.
- I run out of ideas on where to celebrate my mom’s birthday
- Tired of working, want to have a good staycation in Singapore but dont know where

We often heard the above from our friend, colleague, family members or any people surrounding us. Moreover, with the travel restriction due to covid-19, we couldn’t travel out of the country to spend our well-deserved holiday. So, how shall we spend our holiday? Staying home is definitely not an option.
